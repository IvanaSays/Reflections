1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Saving space on your computer, collaborating with others, etc. 
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because you may not want all the changes made locally to be available to the public on GitHub. 
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Cloning means making a copy from GitHub to local repository (my computer), or from my computer to a different location on my computer. Forking is 
basically teh same thing, except from GitHub to GitHub. Branches operate on local repositories only - they serve to enable different users to work on the same code without screwing up the master.  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To be able to look at it if you are offline for a while. 
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want others to be able to review them before I merge, when I am unsure of whether they are correct, etc.
