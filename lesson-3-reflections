When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Saving space on your computer, collaborating with others, etc. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because you may not want all the changes made locally to be available to the public on GitHub.
